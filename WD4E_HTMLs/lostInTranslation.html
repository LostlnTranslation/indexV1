            Hello world, my name is Christian. Born and raised in Switzerland, I have always been a restless soul.<br>I was very lucky to be able to travel extensively in my 20s and early 30s. This allowed me to discover many parts of this beautiful planet.<br>But I always dreamed of one day settling down somewhere permanently.<br>Last year, I finally decided to stop letting fear and uncertainty hold me back. So I sold all my things. Packed the few belongings I had left in my backpack and finally hit the road.</p>
            <p>Now I would like to invite you all to join me on what is probably my most adventurous journey yet as I start a new life in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
        <h1 id="MyFavoriteDiscoveries">My Favorite Discoveries (so far)</h1>
            <p>Here's a list of some of my favorite discoveries after living in Bangkok for one month (The list is in no particular order)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aCBvWsTE3jjMR4fY9" target="_blank">Indy Night Market Pinklao</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8vdDockKC3kS6s649" target="_blank">Pak Khlong Talat (Flower Market)</a></li>

                </ul>
        <h1 id="LearningThai">Learning Thai</h1>
            <p>Learning the local language is part of my adventure, as it allows me to better immerse myself in the local culture and familiarize myself with local customs and habits.<br>My language course doesn't start for a few weeks (as I still have to apply for the right visa). But stay tuned to find out more.</p>
            <p>I'll be learning Thai at Duke Language School. You may learn mor about Duke Language School by clicking on the Logo</p>
